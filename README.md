# LandingpageWithUmbraco
This project is built in UmbracoCMS version 8.4.0 and includes Bootstrap styling.

It contains the following pages:
- Landingpage/frontpage
- Sign in page (Can be accessed from the frontpage)
   - Right now it does not contain log in logic
- Sign up page (Can be accessed from the sign in page)
   - Right now it does not contain sign up logic

The UI is based on Bootstrap templates that has been modified to fit the design.
Note: I used the theme named "Agency" as a base for the project.
The theme can be found here: https://startbootstrap.com/themes/agency/

To run the project I used Visual Studio Code and IIS Express.
Most of the work have been done from the Umbraco back office in the browser.
